# PlatformingGame

This is a simple 2D platformer game made by following a tutorial by Brackeys. The project helped me learn the basics of the Godot Engine and game development, including:

- Character movement
- Enemies (slime) that can kill the player
- Platforms and coins
- Background music
- Death mechanics (falling off the map or touching enemies)

The game was built using Godot Engine and GDScript.
